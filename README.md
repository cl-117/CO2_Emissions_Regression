# CO2_Emissions_Regression

This is a regression problem in order to predict the CO2 emissions from various cars in Canada. 
The dataset has been derived from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/debajyotipodder/co2-emission-by-vehicles.

The initial dataset contains 7386 instances over 12 attributes. 
* Make
* Model
* Vehicle Class
* Engine Size
* Cylinders
* Transmission
* Fuel Type
* Fuel Conumption City (L/100 km)
* Fuel Conumption Hwy (L/100 km)
* Fuel Conumption Comb (L/100 km)
* Fuel Conumption Comb (mpg)
* CO2 Emissions(g/km)

We are predicting CO2 Emissions(g/km).
